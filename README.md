## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (version 3.9.0 or higher)
- An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code with the Flutter plugin.
- An Android/iOS emulator or a physical device.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quicknotes.git
    cd quicknotes
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

### Building the APK

To create smaller, optimized APKs for different device architectures, this project uses the `--split-per-abi` flag.

```sh
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

This generates the following files in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`:
- `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (14.2MB)
- `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (16.7MB)
- `app-x86_64-release.apk` (17.8MB)

### ProGuard Configuration

To further reduce app size and obfuscate the code, ProGuard is enabled for release builds. The configuration is stored in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```
-keep class io.flutter.app.** { *; }
-keep class io.flutter.plugins.** { *; }
-keep class io.flutter.embedding.** { *; }
-dontwarn io.flutter.embedding.**
```
